The saga of the jailbroken Kindle

I recently discovered that you can jailbreak Kindles, and I thought, “oh, cool.” Turns out Amazon really dislikes people doing fun things, and they constantly push silent updates to break every new jailbreak. The only solution is to turn on airplane mode. So I flipped it on and started lurking the jailbreak pages, waiting for anything new at all.

My Kindle doesn’t have Special Offers, so adbreak was off the table… or so I thought (dramatic foreshadowing). Two months go by. Still no new winterbreak, no new languagebreak, no new anything. Eventually, I went to the Kindle control website, and there, in a tiny little postscript,t is a yellow box labeled “Enable Special Offers.”

I was stunned. This whole time, I could have just done that.

I immediately hit the button, stuffed my Kindle’s drive full of huge files so Amazon wouldn’t force an OTA update when I turned Wi-Fi back on, and synced it. The ads appeared. I was thrilled. I downloaded the jailbreak instantly and followed every step.

I swapped the ads for the provided executable, deleted the update Amazon had tried and failed to push, and tapped on an ad.

“This ad’s data is malformed. Please sync and try again.”-Amazon.

Sure, Amazon. As if you can stop me at this point.

A little notification popped up saying, “Welcome to adbreak.” I tapped OK. Another appeared, saying “Bang!” I closed it. Terminal logs filled the screen, and the Kindle rebooted.

When it came back, it told me to install the hotfix. Perfect. I downloaded it, ran it as an update using Amazon’s own precious update system against them, and locked the jailbreak to my device. A bit more OTA disabling later, and the jailbreak was permanent.

I freed up my disk, turned Wi-Fi back on, and there was nothing Amazon could do anymore. The moment an update.bin file appeared, my system said nope and deleted it.

A couple of hours later, I had Gambatte-K2 running, giving me Game Boy Color emulation on my Kindle. Not bad for an e-reader.

And if you have a Kindle and want a better community and more things to do with it, just flip on airplane mode and head to the Kindle modding wiki. They will help you out. And there is nothing Amazon can do about it.
